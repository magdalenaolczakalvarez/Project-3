Description

The popularity of AirBnB has skyrocketed over the past decade. A tool that allows travelers to experience destinations like locals instead of tourists. Homeowners also use it to make some extra money by renting out rooms or entire properties. Whether for the better or for the worse, Airbnb has transformed the travel and short-term rental industry.

Data

This analysis relied on data provided by InsideAirbnb.com, an open source tool that scrapes Airbnb data to answer my question about how Airbnb data affects a city's housing landscape. 
Raw data provided by them is extremely useful. There are four datasets that they have available for Washington, D.C:

Listings: The listings dataset includes the bulk of the data — listing names, locations (latitude/longitude), neighborhoods, hosts, room types, prices, minimum nights the listing must be booked for, the number    of reviews for that listing, the date when the last review was written, the average number of reviews per month, availability (number of days out of 365 the listing is available for booking), and the number of    listings per host.

Reviews: There are almost 505,377,000 reviews associated with unique listing ids. These are the same listing ids as in the Listings dataset. The dates of these reviews range from January 2023 to the time the 
data was collected.

Neighborhoods: This includes a list of 40 defined neighborhoods as well as a geojson file that defines each neighborhood's boundary coordinates.

Calendars: This dataset represents a ‘calendar’ of prices and listings for each day for the following year (from the time the data was collected).

Housing

The statistics displayed on this graph indicate that 71% of the listings in DC are for a etire home or apartment. Although this could result in higher profits for hosts and AirBnB, it also means that over 4000 potential housing units will not be accessible to residents throughout the year, which may concern housing regulators.
